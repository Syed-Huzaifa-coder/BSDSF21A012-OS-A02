3. Copied starter code into `src/`.
4. Created directories: bin/, obj/, man/.
5. Created REPORT.md and updated README.md.
6. Updated Makefile to build bin/ls.
7. Ran `make` and tested `./bin/ls`.

## Q1: What is the crucial difference between the stat() and lstat() system calls? In the context of the ls command, when is it more appropriate to use lstat()?

stat(): Returns information about the target file. If the file is a symbolic link, stat() follows the link and reports information about the file the link points to.

lstat(): Returns information about the link itself. If the file is a symbolic link, lstat() reports details about the link (permissions, size of the link path, etc.), not the target file.

ðŸ‘‰ In the context of the ls command, lstat() is more appropriate because when we use ls -l, we need to show details of the link itself (like link_to_file1 -> file1.txt), not just the target file.

## Q2: The st_mode field in struct stat is an integer that contains both the file type (e.g., regular file, directory) and the permission bits. Explain how you can use bitwise operators (like &) and predefined macros (like S_IFDIR or S_IRUSR) to extract this information.

The st_mode field stores bitwise flags representing both file type and permissions.
We can use bitwise AND (&) with macros to check specific bits.

// Check file type
if (st.st_mode & S_IFDIR) {
    printf("This is a directory\n");
}
if (S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("This is a regular file\n");
}

// Check permissions
if (st.st_mode & S_IRUSR) {
    printf("Owner has read permission\n");
}
if (st.st_mode & S_IWGRP) {
    printf("Group has write permission\n");
}
if (st.st_mode & S_IXOTH) {
    printf("Others have execute permission\n");
}
Using bitwise operators allows us to extract file type and permissions individually from st_mode. This is how the ls -l command prints the familiar drwxr-xr-x style output.
